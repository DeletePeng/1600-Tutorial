# Layer 3: Network Layer

The third layer is the Network Layer.  Many data packets are very large, and thus there are limits on the size. Therefore, something must be done about that. The network layer breaks up chunks into packets, then puts them back together when those chunks are delivered . Additionally, it must find the optimal path to get those packets to its destination. There are several different ways to find this optimal path, but the Network Layer will ultimately figure it out.
