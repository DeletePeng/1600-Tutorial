# Layer 5: Session Layer

The session layer controls the connections between different computers.  Therefore, it must take on the responsibility of all the things that go into multiple connections and sessions.  For example, when you stream a movie from Netflix. The session layer has to make sure to line up the audio and video at the same time. Additionally, it handles things such as closing connections and creating recovery points for them. The session layer deals, additionally with security. It makes sure that you're authorized and authenticated to establish those sessions, to ensure both sides remain secure.
