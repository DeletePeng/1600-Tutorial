# Understanding the Open Systems Interconnection model
# 1600-Tutorial
## by Felix Wang

This tutorial will attempt to explain the 7 layers of the Open Systems Interconnection model. OSI is a framework which aids in understanding the architecture of a computer network. The OSI model standardizes the communication functions of a computing system to ensure interoperability across a wide range of systems. This tutorial is intended for users who have a basic understanding of computer, but may not understand complex technical terms. Therefore it will be more large picture than focusing on small details.  Those 7 layers are respectively, 

[Layer 1](Layer1.md)

[Layer 2](Layer2.md)

[Layer 3](Layer3.md)


[Layer 4](Layer4.md)


[Layer 5](Layer5.md)

[Layer 6](Layer6.md)

[Layer 7](Layer7.md)
