# The Physical Layer

The physical layer is exactly what you think it is. It is the actual physical transmission of data  Whether it be electrical, optical, or electromagnetic waves, it is all done via actual physical transmission  of bits. That is done via voltages, pin layout, cabling etc. Raw bit stream is sent over a physical medium, which is all those 0s and 1s.
