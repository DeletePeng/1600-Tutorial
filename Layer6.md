# Layer 6- Presentation Layer

The primary purpose of the presentation layer is the layer which defines the way which the data will be shown. Essentially, this is the syntax and semantic part. For example, it might represent the data as ASCII, ensuring that the data will be correct between the systems. Encryption and decryption is also down at this level, which will either transform the information into an unrecognizable form or convert the encoded data into a readable form. Finally, this layer also undertake actions such data compression which continue to ensure the data can be read.
