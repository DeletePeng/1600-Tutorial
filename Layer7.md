# Layer 7- Application Layer		

We've finally reached the end of our journey. This is Layer 7, the Application Layer. It is the layer which is closest to the user and the one which they directly interact with. The application layer is the one which lets the user get access to the network and utilize it. It is where they will input data and receive the output of the data.  That Application Layer features many functions which find communication partners, figure out resources allocated and ensure the data can be transmitted. Application layer protocols include protocols such as HTTP or FTP. The HTTP protocol for instance sends and receives the data which is then used to create a web page.
