# Layer 4: Transport Layer

The transport layer takes the data and segments it, as well as managing the flow of data. Using several different schemes, it ensures that the network is reliable. One of the most important things which the Transport Layer does is deciding on whether to use TCP or UDP. TCP and UDP are two different internet protocols which the transport layer decides between when it is sending data. Another important task is congestion. The transport layer tests out how many packets it can send at once without the network becoming clogged up, in order to find that happy balance in between.
