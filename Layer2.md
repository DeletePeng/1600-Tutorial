# Layer 2- Data Link

Layer 2 is what you would call the "Data Link Layer." The most important aspect of this layer is that it provides **node to node ** delivery of the data which is sent by the physical layer. It takes cares of any possible errors which may occur. This layer is the most complicated layer, and therefore has two sublayers. Those two sublayers are the Media Access Control layer and the Logical Link Control Layer.  The MAC layer helps to move data packets across shared channels. The LLC layer helps with the flow control which ensures fast computers don't overrun a slower one. It additionally aids in breaking down data packets into smaller chunks as well as checking errors.
